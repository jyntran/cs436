- last time, tin cans and strings
- application is split up
	- link
- suppose we're writing a smartphone game
	- link between two apps called a pipe
1. ***reliability***
	- ***error rate***: sometimes bits in the datagram are flipped
		- ***bit error rate***: what is the probability of an error happening
		- adding redundant infomation ensures that our data does not create errors
		- ***packet loss rate***:
			- e.g. 5/1000 packets lost
			- ***transmission***: have an acknowledgement from destination that it was received
2. ***throughput***:	how many bits can I send per second?
	- e.g. Youtube video loads, pauses, loads again
	- not enough bits are being streamed
	- e.g. Rogers Internet has a rate of 20Mbps
	- do not mix with bandwidth
3. ***delay***:
	- ***speed of light propagation delay***
		- the longer the distance between endpoints, the longer the delay
		- speed of light isn't fast enough between humans
		- e.g. Mars distance
			- if Mars is behind the sun, no link
	- ***queuing delay***
		- link is being used by someone else
		- e.g. waiting in line for Timmies
	- ***link throughput***
		- large file: $10^{6}$ bits
		- link has $10^{3}$ bps
		- ~ 20 mins to download
4. ***security/privacy***:
	- scrambling/unscrambling
	- keys
5. ***cost***:
	- financial, how much money
	- energy
		- relevant for mobile devices
- are all these properties doable

- cookies
	- client/server
	- ***Apache***: a patchy web server 
- ***top level domains***
	- ***hierarchy*** of domains
		- `server101.cs.uwaterloo.ca`
	- ***delegation***: transfers ownership
