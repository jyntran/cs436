## Transport Layer

| transport | 
| network |

| physical |

## Transport services and protocols

- provides ***logical communication*** between app processes on different hosts
- send side: break app messages into ***segments***
	- header: info to reach processor
	- body: content
- receive side: reassembles segments to messages, passes to app layer
	- checks for corruption
- more than one transport protocol available to apps

## Transport vs. network layer

- ***network layer***: logical comm between hosts
- ***transport layer***: logical comm betwen processes
- e.g. multiple people in house A want to send letters to multiple people in house B
	- hosts = houses
	- processes = people

## What transport service does an app need?

- ***reliability***
	- some apps require 100% data transfer
		- e.g. file transfer, web transactions
	- other apps can tolerate data loss
		- e.g. audio
- ***timing***
	- some apps require low delay to be effective
		- e.g. online gaming
- ***throughput***
	- some apps require min. amount of throughput to be effective
		- e.g. multimedia
	- others make use of whatever throughput they can get
		- e.g. elastic apps
- requirements table (slides)

## Internet transport protocols services

- TCP service
	- reliable transport
	- flow control: sender won't overwhelm reader
	- congestion control: throttling
	- does not provide
		- timing
		- min. throughput guarantee
		- security
	- connection-oriented
- UDP service
	- unreliable data transfer
	- does not provide
		- reliability
		- flow control
		- congestion control
		- timing
		- throughput guarantee
		- security
		- connection setup
- so why bother using UDP?
	- speed
	- no throttling
	- need the information in the header
		- sometimes the IP addresses of the receiver isn't enough
- so why only two services?

## Multiplexing/demultiplexing

- multiplexing
	- handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header
- demultiplexing
	- use header info to deliver received segments to correct sectors
- TCP needs destination IP address and port #
- UDP needs port #

## Connectionless demux: example

|Answers|
---
| source port: 6428 <br> dest port: 5775 |
| source port: 5775 <br> dest port: 6428 |

## Connection-oriented demux

- server may support simultaneous TCP sockets

## Connection-oriented demux: example

- TCP has multiple sockets as destinations
- UDP has one single "bucket" destination
