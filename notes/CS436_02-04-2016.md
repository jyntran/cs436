## Transport Layer

| Layer | Description |
---|---
| application | Email, HTTP, SSH, P2P, DNS |
| transport | (next) |
| network | routing diagrams between networks |
| data link | communication between nodes on same link |
| physical | air, copper, fiber |

## Transport services and protocols

- provides ***logical communication*** between app processes on different hosts
- send side: break app messages into ***segments***, passes to network layer
	- header: info
		- destination
		- source
		- TCP has status of connection
	- body: content
- receive side: reassembles segments to messages, passes to app layer
	- checks for corruption
- more than one transport protocol available to apps

## Transport vs. network layer

- ***network layer***: logical comm between hosts
- ***transport layer***: logical comm betwen processes
- e.g. multiple people in house A want to send letters to multiple people in house B
	- hosts = housesj
	- processes = people
	- transport layer = mailers from house A and B
	- network layer = mail service (Canada Post)

## What transport service does an app need?

- ***reliability***
	- some apps require 100% data transfer
		- e.g. file transfer, web transactions
	- other apps can tolerate data loss
		- e.g. audio
- ***timing***
	- some apps require low delay to be effective
		- e.g. online gaming
- ***throughput***
	- some apps require min. amount of throughput to be effective
		- e.g. multimedia
	- others make use of whatever throughput they can get
		- e.g. elastic apps

## Transport service requirements: common apps

Application | Data Loss | Throughput | Time Sensitive
---|---|---|---
file transfer | no loss | elastic | no
e-mail | no loss | elastic | no
web documents | no loss | elastic | no
real-time audio/video | loss-tolerant | audio: 5kbps-1Mbps | yes, 100's msec
stored audio/video | loss-tolerant | video: 10kbps-5Mbps | yes, few sec
interactive games | loss-tolerant | " | yes, 100's msecs
text-messaging | no loss | few kbps up<br>elastic | yes and no

## Internet transport protocols services

- TCP service
	- reliable transport
	- flow control: sender won't overwhelm reader
	- congestion control: throttling
	- connection-oriented
	- does not provide
		- timing
		- min. throughput guarantee
		- security
- UDP service
	- unreliable data transfer
	- does not provide
		- reliability
		- flow control
		- congestion control
		- timing
		- throughput guarantee
		- security
		- connection setup
- so why bother using UDP?
	- speed
	- fine-grained protocol
		- matters in real-time applications
	- no throttling
	- need the information in the header
		- sometimes the IP addresses of the receiver isn't enough
- so why only two services?

## Internet apps: application, transport protocols

Application | Application Layer Protocol | Underlying Transport Protocol
---|---|---
e-mail | SMTP | TCP
remote terminal access | Telnet | TCP
web | HTTP | TCP
file transfer | FTP | TCP
streaming multimedia | HTTP, RTP | TCP or UDP
Internet telephony | SIP, RTP, proprietary (Skype) | TCP or UDP

## Multiplexing/demultiplexing

- multiplexing
	- handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header
- demultiplexing
	- use header info to deliver received segments to correct sectors
- host receives IP datagrams
	- source IP address and destination IP address (total of 32-bits)
	- one transport-layer segment
	- source and destination port #
		- used to direct segment to appropriate socket
- TCP needs destination IP address and port #
- UDP needs port #

## Connectionless demux: example

- UDP segment
	- checks destination port #
	- directs segment to socket with that port #
- IP datagrams with same des. port # but different source IP addresses and/or source port numbers will be directed to same socket at dest.

|Answers|
---
| source port: 6428 <br> dest port: 5775 |
| source port: 5775 <br> dest port: 6428 |

## Connection-oriented demux

- TCP socket
	- 4-tuple (source IP address, source port #, dest. IP address, dest. port #)
- ***demux***: receiver uses all four values to direct segment to appropriate socket
- server host may support many simultaneus TCP sockets
- web servers have different sockets for each connecting client

## Connection-oriented demux: example

- TCP has multiple sockets as destinations
- UDP has one single "bucket" destination

# Water Analogies (Lecture 8 video)

- ***buffer***: bucket that holds packets until a system is ready for them

## Reliability

- messages sent will be delivered
- buffer from source to destination
- error occurs when buffer is full and data is lost
- how to guarantee reliability?
	- send multiple copies
		- $P(\texttt{success}) = 1 - (\texttt{error rate})^{\texttt{# of copies}}$
		- ***timeout***: some amount of time after which we assume packet was dropped
		- ***round trip time***: time for a packet to be sent to destination and for destination to acknowledge
		- $\texttt{timeout} \le \texttt{RTT}$
	- make buffers very large
	- ask for an acknowledgement
		- ***cumulative acknowedgement***: the receiver acknowledges that it correctly received a packet, message, or segment in a stream which implicitly informs the sender that the previous packets were received correctly
			- wastes resources in sending more

- ***3-way handshake***
	- source sends ***SYN*** (synchronise packet)
	- destination sends ***SYN acknowledgement***
	- source sends ***SYN acknowledgement acknowledgement***

- ***flow control***
	- techniques to match a data source's sending rate to the destination's receiving rate
	- as well as network sources between source and destination
	- e.g. water flowing from faucet to bucket to drain
		- we don't want to overflow the bucket nor run out of water
		- if we have another faucet flowing into the bucket, too much water
			- no communication between faucets
	- assume one source and one destination for now
	- objectives
		- simple
		- efficiency
			- minimal overheads
		- fair
			- equal share of resources
		- stable
			- converge to an equilibrium

- ***open-loop flow control***
	- no feedback between sender and receiver
	- admission control 
		- user asks for requirements (descriptor)
		- bandwidth, latency
		- destination admits/rejects request
		- e.g. dial-up Internet
			- one person has access, the rest need to wait until it is free again
		- fair, stable but not efficient

- ***closed-loop flow control***
	- sender and destination dynamically decide on a sending rate
	- ***statistical multiplexing***: devices do not reserve enough bandwidth for communication

- ***explicit***
	- network devices use ***explicit control messages*** to negotiate sending rate
	- is there congestion in the network?

- ***stop and wait***
	- source sends to destination, destination sends back but encounters error
	- when source does not receive acknowledgement, sends again
	- not very efficient

- ***static window***
	- send us packets before waiting
	- $w$ = transmission window = num of unacknowledged packets

- ***explicit congestion notification***
	- bit in each packet header
	- indicates congestion
	- if true, sender needs to back off and lower the send rate

- ***implicit flow control***
	- dynamically adjust transmission window in response to undelivered packets
	- dynamic $w$
		- start at 1
		- slow start
			- for each acknowledgement, double the window size until $w$ reaches a threshold
			- $w_{t} = w_{t-1} + \frac{1}{w_{t-1}}$
			- each acknowledgement, we increase window
