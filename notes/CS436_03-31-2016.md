## Distributed Systems: Implementation and Design Techniques

- ***process***
	- has one or more ***threads***
	- has an ***address space***
- ***fork()***
	- parent creates child
		- negative: child failed
		- 0: child
		- process id (PID) of child (child successful): parent
	- child inherits from parent but anything done to child afterwards remains in child, does not affect parent
	- parent and child have separate address spaces containing separate variables
- threads are a separate scheduled unit of work
	- unlike processes, threads share the same address space (variables)
- ***RPC: Remote Procedure Call***
	- is an IPC (Inter-process communication)
	- processes communicate with one another
		- e.g. sockets
	- RPC in OOP usually called ***RMI (remote method invocation)***
		- e.g. Java
- transactions
	- operations on a database
		- begin_, end_, abort_, read, write
	- atomicity: transaction should complete, if failed then roll back and aborted
- publish/subscribe
	- e.g. RSS feeds
	- if changing to request/response
		- requires a time reference and results need to be timestamped
	- updates are shown immediately

- design techniques
	- hierarchy
		- e.g. DNS
		- if one part fails, the ones below it fail
		- if has caching that is fine
	- redundancy/replication/failover
		- good ideas to replicate
			- machine, database, communication
		- web caching on your hard disk speeds up loading
		- e.g. replicate routers, connect them to each other in subnet
		- main problem
			- consistency
	- indirection
		- e.g. domain never heard of delegation
		- with hierarchy
			- e.g. DNS
		- without hierarchy
			- e.g. broadcast/flooding
	- multiplexing
		- sharing
		- e.g. circuit switched networks, packet switched network links
		- price is higher due to connections
		- performance is lower
		- overhead for addressing
	- resource virtualization
		- illusion that resources is using what the user thinks it is
	- soft-state
		- recorded state
		- when obsolete, another system will take over
			- e.g. locking mechanism
		- short TTL
			- overhead
		- long TTL
			- not as responsive
