- socket programming
	- ***socket***: interface between process and the network service
	- network service is controlled by the OS
	- internet provides two transport services (data delivery services)
		- ***TCP***: reliable connection-oriented data
			- virtual reliable channel by remote processes
			- byte streamed
			- connection is established prior to data exchange
			- process server runs on known port number
				- client contacts server
				- server sends back acceptance
				- connection is established, communication starts
				- connection is closed
		- ***UDP***: unreliable connection
			- multiple users as servers and clients
			- upload size is equivalent to total size of all users

- TCP sockets
	- server socket
		- welcome socket 
			- receive TCP connection request
	- socket
		- client/server socket used to exchange data

- `ssh ubuntu1204-004`
	- TCPServer.java
		- `javac TCPServer.java`
		- `java TCPServer`
- `ssh ubuntu1204-006`
	- TCPClient.java
		- "hostname" into "UBUNTU1204-004"
			- `javac TCPClient.java`
			- `java TCPClient`

- UDP
	- overlay network
	- node = peer
	- edge = connection
	- torrent file
