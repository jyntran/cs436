Internet
- endpoints
- routers
- ISPs
- data centres
- topology
- service
- end-to-end service

Computing devices
- ***hosts***: endsystems (endpoints of communication), at the edge of the Internet
	- desktops
	- smartphones
	- servers (data centres)
	- laptops
	- tablets

computing device --- Internet
- communication links
	- connect device to Internet
	- types
		- wired
			- Ethernet: TP copper
			- coaxial
			- fiber optical
		- wireless
			- wi-fi: radio
			- 4G/LTE: radio
			- satellite
		- simplex
		- duplex
		- half duplex
		- shared
		- dedicated
	- ***bandwidth:*** transmission rate
		- half duplex
		- shared
		- bps: bits per second
		- Bps: bytes per second
		- Kbps: kilobits per second = $10^{3}$ bps
		- Mbps: megabits per second = $10^{6}$ bps
		- Gbps: gigabits per second = $10^{9}$ bps

Wi-fi
- ***IEEE 802.11*** b/g standard
	- b: 11 Mbps
	- g: 54 Mbps

Internet --- access point --- laptop

home network
- ***LAN***: local area network
- connects to access network
- ***ISP***: Internet service provider
- Rogers started with cable TV
- Bell started with phone
- both became ISPs, and are access networks

access network
- ***frequency division multiplexing***
	- cable Internet

| DSL | Cable portion | 
---|---
| ===== | Internet |
| ===== | phone/TV channels |

home DSL/cable modem --- ISP central office --- 1. telephone network 2. Internet core

core
- number of interconnected tier 1-2 ISP networks
	- tier 2 is for global connections
	- mesh of connected routers
	- provide global connectivity
- packet switches
	- (X) router
	- [X] ethernet switch
- ***multihomed***: connected to more than one ISP
- ***autonomous system***
- ***router***: forwards traffic
- data centre --- tier 1 ISP network (X) (X)
	- backup pipe in case primary one is broken
UW has four ISPs
- Cogent: 2Gbps, Tier 1
- Hydro 1: 2Gbps, Tier 2
- Allstream: 4 Gbps, Tier 2
- Orion: 10 Gbps, Tier 2

IPv4 addresses
- ***IP***: Internet protocol
- address connected devices
	- reach network card
- allows core to find the location
- 32 bit IP address -> $2^{32}$ IP address space
	- ~ 4 billion
	- 18 million for private use

private IPv4 addresses
- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
- 172.16.0.0 - 172.255.255

public IP addresses are routable

private address -> NAT -> public address
- ***NAT***: network address translation	
- every private address in the home network is translated to the same public address
- saves addresses
- if multiple devices use the same public address, how would data return to the correct private address?
- in the NAT is a table which matches private address to the router's public address and an identifier number
