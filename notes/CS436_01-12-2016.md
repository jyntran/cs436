- tin can and string
- ***simplex***: one direction
- ***half-duplex***: both directions but only one direction at a time
- ***duplex***: both directions

- Apple gets sued
	- communication with lawyers
	- A1...AN, L1...LN
	- multiple "tin cans" stretching many kilometres
	- however, lots of wires, wasteful
	- if single wire is used and everyone uses that one wire to communicate
		- two router nodes, R1 and R2, belongs to everyone
		- need to give the correct message to correct person
		- unique ***addresses*** help
		- ***port number***: portal for information to enter/exit
		- ***multiplexing***: shared links
		- ***de-multiplexing***: unsharing links
		- router needs to have some way of knowing which destination to send information
	- must be scable
		- what if it needs to grow later?

- service can be overloaded
	- waiting will eventually get service
	- reservation is a good idea
	- sometimes waiting too long and dropping call is easier

- back to Apple and lawyers
	- ***connection oriented system***
		- if A is talking to L, it owns the link
		- nobody else can use that link
		- another can request it after it's done
		- e.g. telephone call
	- ***connection-less system***:
		- requires headers
		- ***datagram***: includes headers of its destination
			- bits of information is saved with A1 and sent to L2
		- other messages can appear with different sender/recipient
		- e.g. Internet

- how to implement tin cans and string on the Internet
	- ***interface***: send to this address and this port number this piece of data
		- send(address, port, data)
		- receive(port)
	- ***client***: 
	- ***server***:
	- computers can have more than one endpoint listening
		- easier to assign port numbers
		- 3600 ports but one address (to conserve addresses)
	- ***pipe***:
		- ***TCP***: transmission control protocol
			- full duplex connection
			- uses IP address
		- ***UDP***: user datagram protocol
	- ***IP address***:
		- ***private***
			- local
			- not reachable, no meaning outside domain
			- e.g.
				- 10.xx.xx.xx
				- 192.168.xx.xx
		- ***public***
			- reachable from everywhere
		- if router receives a private address, it automatically drops
		- assigned by ***DHCP***
		- approx. 10Mbps for local networks
- ***network address translation (NAT)***
	- source address and destination address is public - ok
	- if any is public, automatic drop
	- very useful
		- gives notion of public and private addresses
		- saves on public addresses
		- private addresses are safe from attacks
		- commonly used
	- Skype problem
		- cannot contact someone using their private address

- ***SSH***
	- client/serve protocol
	- way to send commands over a network
	- secure
	- on Internet, by default connections are not secure
		- every router has a ***compliance port*** makes copies of every packet and are sent to the NSA
		- eavesdropping occurs
	- keys infrastructure
		 - implement privacy and security
	- ***NFS***: networked file system
		- local filesystem and directories mapped to a server's remote filesystem
		- mounted to a cloud service
		- always connected
		- prediction: all personal data will be stored in a data centre somewhere in 5-6 years

- ***WWW***: World Wide Web
	- client: browser
	- server
	- uses TCP connection to talk to web server
	- request/response system
	- file that comes back: ***HTML*** (Hypertext markup language)
		- contains ***URLs*** and ***hyperlinks***
		- allows to access other resources
		- text-based
	- HTML 1.0, HTML 1.1
	- ***GET*** method
		- location: /somedir/somefile.html
		- version: HTML/1.1
		- host: URL
		- user-agent: Mozilla
		- accept-language: en
	- telnet uwaterloo.ca 80
		- connect to uwaterloo.ca on port 80
	- response examples
		- HTTP/1.1 200 OK
			- content-type: text
		- HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
	- ***cookie***
		- long string of numbers
		- kept by browser
		- the next time it makes the request to same destination, it uses that cookie again
		- cookie database
			- IP
			- cookie
			- user info
		- if no cookie is set, one is made for you unless specified
			- prevent tracking
