- protocols
	- HTTP
	- TCP
	- IP
	- IEEE 802.11
- ***Internet protocol stack*** (top to bottom)
	1. ***application layer*** (HTTP)
	2. ***transport layer*** (TCP)
	3. ***network layer*** (IP)
	4. ***data link layer*** (IEEE 802.11)
	5. ***physical layer***
		- hardware
- application running on the Internet
	- can be either
		- ***client/server (C/S)***
			- server
				- always on server
				- dedicated machine(s)
				- usually has a static IP address
			- client
				- piece of program that communicates with the server
				- may have different implementations
				- e.g. the browser is the client of the web application
		- ***peer-to-peer (P2P)***
			- peer
				- not always on
				- no dedicated machines
				- usually do not have static IP addresses
				- also known as ***servent*** (_server_ and _client_)
- C/S file sharing app
	- user (client, user-agent) connects to a server
	- a database (DB) is connected to the server, contains files to be shared
	- user can send a request
		- upload files to the server
		- download files from the server
	- e.g. Dropbox
- P2P file sharing
	- consists of machines
	- files are located on the user's machine
	- users can connect to one another
		- request to download a file from another user
		- request to upload a file to another user
- advantage of P2P
	- self-scaling
- disadvantages of P2P
	- may have limit on the number of connected users
	- without sharing files can be lost
		- incentives are created to share
- web
	- ***HTTP***: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
		- application layer protocol
		- C/S model
			- client: browser
			- server: web server
		- request/response protocol
			- requests sent by browser
			- response sent by web server
			- ***objects*** are sent
		- generally request a web page identified by a URL
			- e.g. browser and UW web server
				- browser requests web page (www.uwaterloo.ca)
				- server responds with a web page (index.html)
				- browser parses index file
				- browser requests for object
				- server responds with object
				- ...
				- browser displays objects
				- server other than UW's
					- browser requests for CBC object from (cbc.ca)
					- CBC server responds with object
					- browser displays CBC object
		- ***stateless protocol***
			- no memorization, does not keep track of the objects downloaded
				- e.g. request a file twice, server responds with file twice
		- how to make HTTP stateful?
			- ***cookie***
				- set of data sent by the web server and stored by the client's browser
				- usually has an expiry date
				- inserted in the response of HTTP request
				- e.g. Amazon.ca
					- first visit request, no cookie
					- server responds, sets cookie on machine
					- next visit, when request, sends cookie back to server
					- server responds, modifies DB entry with information (account details, purchases, recommendations, items in cart)
						- responses are customized as soon as it recognizes you
- big web server
	- web proxy server
		- cache
	- load balancer
	- presentation
		- server
	- business
		- logic
	- database
- ***domain name system (DNS)***
	- converting (resolving, translating) domain names to IP addresses
	- used for ***aliasing***
		- if host has changed, the old name becomes an alias for the new one
		- e.g. UW
			- host: ubuntu1204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca
			- higher than .ca is ***root*** (13 replicated root name servers (a,...,m))
				- .ca
					- name server (NS) of uwaterloo.ca
				- .fr
				- .com
